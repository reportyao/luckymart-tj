Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.1

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "eslint-plugin-security".

(The package "eslint-plugin-security" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/workspace/luckymart-tj".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install eslint-plugin-security@latest --save-dev

The plugin "eslint-plugin-security" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc.json".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
